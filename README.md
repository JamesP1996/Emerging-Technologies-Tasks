# Emerging-Technologies-Tasks

This Repository contains tasks I was requested to complete in Python using Jupyter Notebook , Matplotlib , NumPy, Scikit-Learn , Pandas , Scipy.
Many of these tasks are statistical or mathamatical based tasks.

**List of Tasks**
1. Square Root of 2 *without Libary's Implementation*
2. Chi-Squared Test
3. **STDEV.P** and **STDEV.S** Standard Deviation
4. Scikit-Learn to  apply k-means  clustering  to **Fisherâ€™s  famous  Iris  data  set**


## How to Run From Github
To run the Jupyter Notebook on Github, open the **Tasks.ipynb** file and all of the code cells should automatically run on the webpage displayed.

## How to Run the Notebook from Local Machine

### Requirements
- **Python With PIP /  Anaconda**
- **Jupyter Notebook (Install through Pip Package Manager/ Anaconda Package Manager)**

**Anaconda Package Manager Requirements**
<br>Anaconda comes with many of these statistical / mathamatical libary's pre-installed so you only need to install Juptyr Notebook for Anaconda
- **Jupyter Notebook**
<br>``` conda install -c conda-forge notebook ```
<br>

**PIP Package Manager Library Requirements**
- **Juptyr NoteBook** <br>
```pip install jupyterlab```
- **Matplotlib** <br>
```pip install matplotlib```
- **NumPy** <br>
```pip install numpy```
- **Sckit-Learn** <br>
```pip install scikit-learn```
- **Pandas**<br>
```pip install pandas```
- **Scipy**<br>
```pip install scipy```

### Running the Notebook 
Open the Folder where you cloned/downloaded this repository in a terminal.
Then inside the command line, type "```jupyter notebook```" , if you have installed the requirements correctly, the terminal should open up a web page on your local machine with the directory in view. Click on **Tasks.ipynb** to open up the notebook in the browser and then use the Run button to run any of the python code or markdown cells that are not already running.
